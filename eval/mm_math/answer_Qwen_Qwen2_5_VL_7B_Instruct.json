  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of quadrilateral \\(CEFG\\). Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the coordinates of the points:**\n   - Since \\(ABCD\\) is a rectangle with \\(AB = 6\\) and \\(AD = 10\\), we can place the points as follows:\n     - \\(A = (0, 6)\\)\n     - \\(B = (0, 0)\\)\n     - \\(C = (10, 0)\\)\n     - \\(D = (10, 6)\\)\n     - Let \\(E = (x, 0)\\) where \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 10\\).\n\n2. **Determine the coordinates of point \\(F\\):**\n   - When \\(\\triangle BCE\\) is folded along \\(BE\\), point \\(C\\) falls on point \\(F\\) on side \\(AD\\). This means that \\(F\\) is the reflection of \\(C\\) over \\(BE\\).

The slope of \\(BE\\) is 0, so the equation of \\(BE\\) is \\(y = 0\\).\n   - The coordinates of \\(F\\) are \\((x, 6)\\) because it is the reflection of \\(C = (10, 0)\\) over the line \\(y = 0\\).\n\n3. **Determine the coordinates of point \\(G\\):**\n   - Since \\(FG \\parallel CD\\), the y-coordinate of \\(G\\) is 0. Let the coordinates of \\(G\\) be \\((y, 0)\\).\n   - Since \\(G\\) lies on the line \\(BE\\), the coordinates of \\(G\\) are \\((y, 0)\\).\n\n4. **Determine the length of \\(CE\\):**\n   - The length of \\(CE\\) is the distance from \\(C = (10, 0)\\) to \\(E = (x, 0)\\), which is \\(10 - x\\).\n\n5. **Determine the length of \\(FG\\):**\n   - The length of \\(FG\\) is the distance from \\(F = (x, 6)\\) to \\(G = (y, 0)\\), which is \\(6\\).\n\n6. **Determine the length of \\(CG\\):**\n   - The length of \\(CG\\) is the distance from \\(C = (10, 0)\\) to \\(G = (y, 0)\\), which is \\(10 - y\\).\n\n7. **Determine the length of \\(EG\\):**\n   - The length of \\(EG\\) is the distance from \\(E = (x, 0)\\) to \\(G = (y, 0)\\), which is \\(y - x\\).\n\nSince \\(CEFG\\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal.

Consider a line $l: y=mx+b$ passing through point $D$. When the angle between line $l$ and line $AB$ is equal to $45^\\circ$, find the corresponding value of $m$.\n",

Since the line \\( AB \\) passes through point \\( A \\) and the coordinates of point \\( D \\) are \\( (8, 0) \\), we can use the fact that the line \\( AD \\) is the line \\( AB \\) reflected over the line \\( AB \\). The slope of the line \\( AD \\) is the same as the slope of the line \\( AB \\) because the line \\( AD \\) is the line \\( AB \\) reflected over the line \\( AB \\).\n\nThe slope of the line \\( AD \\) is the same as the slope of the line \\( AB \\), which is \\( k \\). Therefore, the slope of the line \\( AD \\) is \\( k \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the line \\( l \\). The line \\( l \\) forms a \\( 45^\\circ \\) angle with the line \\( AB \\). The slope of a line that forms a \\( 45^\\circ \\) angle with another line is either \\( 1 \\) or \\( -1 \\). Therefore, the slope \\( m \\) of the line \\( l \\) can be either \\( 1 \\) or \\( -1 \\).\n\nSince the line \\( l \\) passes through the point \\( D \\) and the coordinates of point \\( D \\) are \\( (8, 0) \\), we can substitute \\( x = 8 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) into the equation of the line \\( l \\) to find the value of \\( b \\).\n\nIf \\( m = 1 \\), the equation of the line \\( l \\) is \\( y = x + b \\). Substituting \\( x = 8 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ 0 = 8 + b \\implies b = -8. \\]\nSo, the equation of the line \\( l \\) is \\( y = x - 8 \\).\n\nIf \\( m = -1 \\), the equation of the line \\( l \\) is \\( y = -x + b \\). Substituting \\( x = 8 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ 0 = -8 + b \\implies b = 8. \\]\nSo, the equation of the line \\( l \\) is \\( y = -x + 8 \\).\n\nSince the problem does not specify which of the two slopes to choose, we can choose either one. However, the problem asks for the corresponding value of \\( m \\), and both values are valid. For the sake of a single answer, we can choose either \\( m = 1 \\) or \\( m = -1 \\). Conventionally, we choose the positive value.\n\nTherefore, the corresponding value of \\( m \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

The circumference of the circle is \\(2\\pi R\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius of the circumcircle. The length of the arc \\(\\overset{\\frown}{DC}\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of } \\overset{\\frown}{DC} = \\frac{\\angle BOC}{360^\\circ} \\times 2\\pi R = \\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\times 2\\pi R = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2\\pi R = \\frac{\\pi R}{3}\n   \\]\n   To find \\(R\\), we use the fact that \\(BC = 4\\) and \\(\\angle BOC = 60^\\circ\\). The length of the arc \\(\\overset{\\frown}{BC}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of } \\overset{\\frown}{BC} = \\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\times 2\\pi R = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2\\pi R = \\frac{\\pi R}{3}\n   \\]\n   The length of the arc \\(\\overset{\\frown}{BC}\\) is also equal to the length of the chord \\(BC\\), which is 4. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\pi R}{3} = 4 \\implies R = \\frac{12}{\\pi}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(R\\) back into the formula for the length of the arc \\(\\overset{\\frown}{DC}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of } \\overset{\\frown}{DC} = \\frac{\\pi \\times \\frac{12}{\\pi}}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the minor arc \\(\\overset{\\frown}{DC}\\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Therefore, \\( \\frac{DE}{BC} = \\frac{AE}{AB} \\).\n\n4. **Set up the proportion:**\n   - Let \\( EB = x \\). Since \\( E \\) is on \\( BA \\), \\( AE = AB - EB = AB - x \\).\n   - The proportion can be written as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{DE}{BC} = \\frac{AE}{AB} \\implies \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{BC} = \\frac{AB - x}{AB}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the proportion:**\n   - Since \\( \\frac{DE}{BC} = \\frac{AE}{AB} \\), we can substitute \\( AE = AB - x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{BC} = \\frac{AB - x}{AB}\n     \\]\n   - Cross-multiplying gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot AB = BC \\cdot (AB - x)\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{2} AB = BC \\cdot AB - BC \\cdot x\n     \\]\n   - Rearrange to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{2} AB + BC \\cdot x = BC \\cdot AB\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     BC \\cdot x = BC \\cdot AB - \\frac{5}{2} AB\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = AB - \\frac{5}{2}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Determine the value of \\( EB \\):**\n   - Since \\( EB = x \\) and we need to find the value of \\( EB \\), we use the fact that \\( EB = \\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( EB \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}\\).",

Substituting \\( y = 3 \\) into the equation of the parabola, we get:\n   \\[\n   3 = -b^2 + 6b + 3\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   0 = -b^2 + 6b \\implies b(b - 6) = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\( b = 0 \\) or \\( b = 6 \\). Since \\( B \\) is to the right of \\( A \\), we have \\( b = 6 \\). Therefore, the coordinates of \\( B \\) are \\( (6, 3) \\).\n\n3. **Find the coordinates of point \\( P \\):**\n   Let the coordinates of \\( P \\) be \\( (x, -x^2 + 6x + 3) \\). Since \\( PA \\) is a straight line and \\( P \\) is above \\( AB \\), the slope of \\( PA \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } PA = \\frac{-x^2 + 6x + 3 - 3}{x - 0} = \\frac{-x^2 + 6x}{x} = -x + 6\n   \\]\n   The slope of \\( OB \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } OB = \\frac{3 - 0}{6 - 0} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( PQ \\) is perpendicular to \\( AB \\), the slope of \\( PQ \\) is the negative reciprocal of the slope of \\( AB \\), which is 0. Therefore, the slope of \\( PQ \\) is undefined, meaning \\( PQ \\) is a vertical line. The coordinates of \\( Q \\) are \\( (x, 3) \\).\n\n4. **Use the angle condition \\( \\angle APQ = \\angle B \\):**\n   The angle \\( \\angle APQ \\) is the angle between the line \\( PA \\) and the vertical line \\( PQ \\). The angle \\( \\angle B \\) is the angle between the horizontal line \\( AB \\) and the line \\( OB \\). Since \\( \\angle APQ = \\angle B \\), the slope of \\( PA \\) must be equal to the slope of \\( OB \\), which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   -x + 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies -x = \\frac{1}{2} - 6 = -\\frac{11}{2} \\implies x = \\frac{11}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} \\) into the equation of the parabola, we get:\n   \\[\n   y = -\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)^2 + 6 \\cdot \\frac{11}{2} + 3 = -\\frac{121}{4} + \\frac{66}{2} + 3 = -\\frac{121}{4} + \\frac{132}{4} + \\frac{12}{4} = \\frac{23}{4}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coordinates of point \\( P \\) are \\( \\left( \\frac{11}{2}, \\frac{23}{4} \\right) \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{11}{2}, \\frac{23}{4} \\right)}\n\\]",

The x-coordinate of \\(B\\) is \\(1\\), so the coordinates of \\(B\\) are \\((1, 0)\\).\n\n2. **Determine the y-intercept \\(C\\):**\n   Since \\(OA = OC\\) and \\(A = (-3, 0)\\), the y-coordinate of \\(C\\) must be \\(3\\) (because the distance from the origin to \\(A\\) is 3 units, and since \\(C\\) is on the y-axis, its y-coordinate is the same as the distance from the origin to \\(A\\)). Therefore, the coordinates of \\(C\\) are \\((0, 3)\\).\n\n3. **Find the equation of the parabola:**\n   The parabola passes through points \\(A(-3, 0)\\), \\(B(1, 0)\\), and \\(C(0, 3)\\). The general form of the parabola is \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\). Substituting the coordinates of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   0 = 9a - 3b + c\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 = a + b + c\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 = c\n   \\]\n   From the third equation, we have \\(c = 3\\). Substituting \\(c = 3\\) into the first two equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   0 = 9a - 3b + 3 \\implies 9a - 3b = -3 \\implies 3a - b = -1 \\implies b = 3a + 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 = a + b + 3 \\implies a + b = -3 \\implies a + (3a + 1) = -3 \\implies 4a + 1 = -3 \\implies 4a = -4 \\implies a = -1\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(a = -1\\) into \\(b = 3a + 1\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   b = 3(-1) + 1 = -3 + 1 = -2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the equation of the parabola is:\n   \\[\n   y = -x^2 - 2x + 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the coordinates of point \\(P\\):**\n   Let the coordinates of point \\(P\\) be \\((x, y)\\). The area of \\(\\triangle POC\\) is given as 4 times the area of \\(\\triangle BOC\\). The area of \\(\\triangle BOC\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of } \\triangle BOC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the area of \\(\\triangle POC\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of } \\triangle POC = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n   The area of \\(\\triangle POC\\) is also given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of } \\triangle POC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times |x| = \\frac{3}{2} |x|\n   \\]\n   Setting the two expressions for the area equal, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{2} |x| = 6 \\implies |x| = 4 \\implies x = 4 \\text{ or } x = -4\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -4\\) into the equation of the parabola \\(y = -x^2 - 2x + 3\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   y = -4^2 - 2(4)",

Let the side length of the square be \\(s\\).

Since the equilateral triangle \\(AEF\\) is inscribed in the circle and \\(AE = 6\\), the side length of the equilateral triangle is also 6. The radius of the circle can also be expressed in terms of the side length of the equilateral triangle.

Since \\(E\\) is on the circle and \\(AE = 6\\), the coordinates of \\(E\\) can be determined, but we can use the fact that the height of the equilateral triangle is the same as the height of the square when considering the intersection points.\n\nThe length \\(EG\\) is the vertical distance from \\(E\\) to the line \\(BC\\), which is the height of the equilateral triangle minus the height of the square:\n\\[\nEG = 3\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the exact coordinates are not necessary for the length of \\(EG\\) in this context, we can use the fact that the length of \\(EG\\) is simply the height of the equilateral triangle minus the height of the square, which simplifies to:\n\\[\nEG = 3\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nBut the exact simplified form for the length of \\(EG\\) is:\n\\[\nEG = 3\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nThe radius of the circle is:\n\\[\nR = 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThe length of \\(EG\\) is:\n\\[\nEG = 3\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nThe final answers are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{3\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{6}}\n\\]",

Since \\( \\angle BAC = 30^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle C = 90^\\circ \\), \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is a 30-60-90 triangle. The length of \\( AB \\) is 4 (since \\( B = (3,0) \\) and \\( A = (-1,0) \\)).

The general form of a parabola is \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\), where \\( (h,k) \\) is the vertex.

This means that \\(BE = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} BC\\). Since \\(E\\) is on \\(BC\\) and \\(EF = 9\\), we can find \\(BE\\) and \\(EC\\). Let \\(BC = x\\).

Therefore, the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are \\((-12, 0)\\) and \\((6, 0)\\) respectively.\n\n2. **Determine the coordinates of point \\(B\\):**\n\n   The line \\(AB\\) intersects the \\(y\\)-axis at point \\(B\\). Since \\(A = (-12, 0)\\), the slope of line \\(AB\\) is the same as the slope of line \\(CD\\). Let the coordinates of \\(B\\) be \\((0, b)\\). The slope of line \\(AB\\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } AB = \\frac{b - 0}{0 - (-12)} = \\frac{b}{12}\n   \\]\n\n   The slope of line \\(CD\\) is the same as the slope of line \\(AB\\), so the slope of line \\(CD\\) is \\(\\frac{b}{12}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the coordinates of point \\(D\\):**\n\n   The line \\(CD\\) intersects the \\(y\\)-axis at point \\(D\\). Since \\(C = (6, 0)\\), the slope of line \\(CD\\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope of } CD = \\frac{b - 0}{0 - 6} = -\\frac{b}{6}\n   \\]\n\n   The slope of line \\(CD\\) is also \\(\\frac{b}{12}\\), so we have:\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{b}{6} = \\frac{b}{12}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\(b\\):\n\n   \\[\n   -2b = b \\implies 3b = 0 \\implies b = 0\n   \\]\n\n   This is not possible since \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are not the same point. Instead, we need to use the given information about \\(\\tan \\angle ABO = \\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n4. **Use the given information \\(\\tan \\angle ABO = \\frac{3}{4}\\):**\n\n   The slope of line \\(AB\\) is \\(\\frac{b}{12}\\). Since \\(\\tan \\angle ABO = \\frac{3}{4}\\), the slope of line \\(AB\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). Therefore:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{12} = \\frac{3}{4} \\implies b = 9\n   \\]\n\n   So, the coordinates of point \\(B\\) are \\((0, 9)\\) and the coordinates of point \\(D\\) are \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n5. **Determine the coordinates of point \\(E\\):**\n\n   The coordinates of point \\(E\\) can be found by solving the system of equations of lines \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\). The equation of line \\(AB\\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{3}{4}x + 9\n   \\]\n\n   The equation of line \\(CD\\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 9\n   \\]\n\n   Setting the equations equal to each other:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4}x + 9 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 9",

The midpoint of \\(AB\\) is \\((1, \\sqrt{3})\\). The slope of \\(AB\\) is \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\), so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).

It is known that the center $O$ is always above the water surface. When the chord $AB$ intercepted by the water surface is $6\\text{m}$, the maximum depth of the water tank below the surface is $1\\text{m}$ (i.e., the maximum distance from a point on the circle below the surface to the water surface). If the water level rises causing the chord $AB$ intercepted by the water surface to change from the original $6\\text{m}$ to $8\\text{m}$, what is the new maximum depth of the water tank below the surface, in meters?\n",
  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the circle and then use it to find the new maximum depth of the water tank below the surface when the chord length changes.\n\nFirst, let's denote the radius of the circle by \\( R \\).

Let's denote the perpendicular distance from \\( O \\) to \\( AB \\) by \\( d \\). Then we have:\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{R^2 - \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{R^2 - 9} \\]\nSince \\( d = R - 1 \\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[ R - 1 = \\sqrt{R^2 - 9} \\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[ (R - 1)^2 = R^2 - 9 \\]\n\\[ R^2 - 2R + 1 = R^2 - 9 \\]\n\\[ -2R + 1 = -9 \\]\n\\[ -2R = -10 \\]\n\\[ R = 5 \\]\nSo, the radius of the circle is 5 meters.

The base of \\(\\triangle APN\\) is \\(x\\) and the base of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is \\(100\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\frac{x}{40} = \\frac{100 - x}{100}\\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{40} = \\frac{100 - x}{100}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100x = 40(100 - x)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100x = 4000 - 40x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   140x = 4000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4000}{140} = \\frac{200}{7}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate \\(BN\\) and \\(CM\\):**\n   - \\(BN = 100 - x = 100 - \\frac{200}{7} = \\frac{700}{7} - \\frac{200}{7} = \\frac{500}{7}\\)\n   - \\(CM = x = \\frac{200}{7}\\)\n\n7. **Find \\(BN \\cdot CM\\):**\n   \\[\n   BN \\cdot CM = \\left(\\frac{500}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{200}{7}\\right) = \\frac{100000}{49}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(BN \\cdot CM\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{100000}{49}}\\).",

  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of \\(CD\\) after the right-angled triangle \\(ABC\\) is folded along \\(BD\\) such that point \\(A\\) falls on \\(BC\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the length of \\(BC\\) using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\(ABC\\):\n\\[\nBC = \\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5.\n\\]\n\nWhen triangle \\(ABC\\) is folded along \\(BD\\), point \\(A\\) falls on \\(BC\\).

Since \\(A'\\) lies on \\(BC\\), we need to find the coordinates of \\(A'\\) and then determine the length of \\(CD\\).\n\nSince \\(A'\\) is the image of \\(A\\) after the fold, the distance \\(BA' = BA = 3\\). Let \\(D\\) be the point on \\(AC\\) such that \\(BD\\) is the fold line. The coordinates of \\(A\\) are \\((0, 4)\\) and the coordinates of \\(B\\) are \\((3, 0)\\). The coordinates of \\(C\\) are \\((0, 0)\\).\n\nThe fold line \\(BD\\) is the perpendicular bisector of \\(AA'\\). Since \\(A'\\) is on \\(BC\\), we can use the fact that the coordinates of \\(A'\\) are \\((x, 0)\\) where \\(x\\) is the x-coordinate of \\(A'\\) on \\(BC\\). The length of \\(BA'\\) is 3, so we can use the distance formula to find \\(x\\):\n\\[\nBA' = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = 3 \\implies (x - 3)^2 = 9 \\implies x - 3 = \\pm 3.\n\\]\nSince \\(x\\) must be between 0 and 5, we have \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 6\\).

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the coordinates of point A:**\n   - The x-coordinate of point A is given as 2. Since point A lies on the line \\(y = ax\\), the y-coordinate of A is \\(2a\\). Therefore, the coordinates of A are \\((2, 2a)\\).\n\n2. **Determine the slope of line BC:**\n   - The line BC intersects the x-axis at point C and the y-axis at point B. Since the line \\(y = ax\\) intersects the line BC at point A, the slope of line BC must be the same as the slope of line \\(y = ax\\), which is \\(a\\).

The correct interpretation is that the area of \\(\\triangle ABO\\) is 1, and the base is 2, so the height must be 1. This means the y-coordinate of B is 1, and the y-coordinate of A is \\(2a\\).

  "response": "To solve for the length of \\(MN\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the length of \\(AM\\) and \\(MC\\).\n2. Determine the length of \\(CN\\) and \\(NB\\).\n3. Calculate the length of \\(MN\\).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the length of \\(AM\\) and \\(MC\\).**\n\nSince \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\), we have:\n\\[ AM = MC = \\frac{AC}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the length of \\(CN\\) and \\(NB\\).**\n\nWe know that \\(CN = \\frac{1}{2}NB\\). Let \\(CN = x\\). Then \\(NB = 2x\\). Since \\(CN + NB = CB\\), we have:\n\\[ x + 2x = 15 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 15 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\nSo, \\(CN = 5 \\, \\text{cm}\\) and \\(NB = 10 \\, \\text{cm}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the length of \\(MN\\).**\n\nThe length of \\(MN\\) is the sum of the lengths \\(MC\\) and \\(CN\\):\n\\[ MN = MC + CN = 3 + 5 = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of \\(MN\\) is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
