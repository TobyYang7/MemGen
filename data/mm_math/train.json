Because $\\triangle ADM\\sim \\triangle ABC$, we get $\\frac{AM}{AC}=\\frac{MD}{BC}$. Considering $DM=x$, we find $\\frac{AM}{3}=\\frac{x}{4}$, which means $AM=\\frac{3}{4}x$. Therefore, $AD=\\sqrt{AM^2+DM^2}=\\frac{5}{4}x$. Thus, $CD=AC-AD=3-\\frac{5}{4}x$. Given $\\triangle ADM\\sim \\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle DEC\\sim \\triangle ABC$, it follows that $\\triangle ADM\\sim \\triangle DEC$.
