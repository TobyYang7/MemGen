Draw FM$\\perp$BC at M, intersecting AD at N. Draw AH$\\perp$EF at H through point A, and draw EG$\\perp$AF at G through point E. Then, quadrilaterals ABMN and CDNM are rectangles, thus $AB=MN=CD=12$, AN=BM, and by the folding property, CE=EF. Also, $\\angle CED=\\angle DEF=30^\\circ$, thus DE=2CD=24, and $\\angle CEF=60^\\circ$. By the Pythagorean theorem, CE=EF=$\\sqrt{DE^2-CD^2}=\\sqrt{24^2-12^2}=12\\sqrt{3}$, which makes $\\triangle CEF$ an equilateral triangle. Thus, ME=CM=$\\frac{1}{2}$CE=$6\\sqrt{3}$. By the Pythagorean theorem again, FM=$\\sqrt{EF^2-ME^2}=\\sqrt{(12\\sqrt{3})^2-(6\\sqrt{3})^2}=18$. Since AE$\\perp$DE and $\\angle CDE=\\angle DEF=30^\\circ$, it follows that $\\angle AEH=\\angle AEB=60^\\circ$, and $\\angle ABE=\\angle AHE=90^\\circ$, making AH=AB=12 and $\\angle HAE=\\angle BAE=30^\\circ$. Hence, AE=2BE. By applying the Pythagorean theorem: $AB^2+BE^2=AE^2$ gives $12^2+BE^2=4BE^2$, from which we get BE=$4\\sqrt{3}$. Consequently, AN=BE+ME=$4\\sqrt{3}+6\\sqrt{3}=10\\sqrt{3}$, and FN=FM−MN=18−12=6. Therefore, AF=$\\sqrt{AN^2+FN^2}=\\sqrt{(10\\sqrt{3})^2+6^2}=4\\sqrt{21}$. From $S_{\\triangle AEF}=\\frac{1}{2}AF\\cdot EG=\\frac{1}{2}EF\\cdot AH$, we derive $\\frac{1}{2}\\times 4\\sqrt{21}\\cdot EG=\\frac{1}{2}\\times 12\\sqrt{3}\\times 12$, solving for EG yields $\\boxed{\\frac{36\\sqrt{7}}{7}}$.",

To estimate the size of the pond, observers at points A and D noticed that points A, E, C and D, E, B are on the same straight line.

In $\\triangle AOG$, $AG^{2}$+$OG^{2}=AO^{2}$, that is $4.8^{2}+(6.4−r)^{2}=r^{2}$. Solving this yields: $r=\\boxed{5}$ meters, that is, the radius is 5 meters.

As shown in the figure, let the center of the large circle be $O_{1}$, make $O_{1}M\\perp AC$ at point M, and connect $O_{1}C$. Since AD=9.6 meters, DF=2.4 meters, therefore $AF=9.6+2.4=12$ meters.
