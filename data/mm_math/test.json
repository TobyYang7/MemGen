On segment $AB$, a moving point $M$ starts from point $A$ moving towards point $B$ at a uniform speed, while another moving point $N$ starts from point $B$ moving towards point $A$ at a uniform speed. When one of the points $M$ or $N$ stops moving, the other point stops as well. Perpendiculars are drawn from points $M$ and $N$ to $AB$, intersecting the lines containing the right angle sides $AC$ and $BC$ at points $D$ and $E$ respectively. $DE$ is then connected. If the movement time is $t$ seconds, during the movement, the quadrilateral $DENM$ is always a rectangle (except when points $M$ and $N$ coincide). During the movement, if the speed of point $M$ is 1 unit length per second, find the speed of point $N$. For what value of $t$ seconds does the rectangle $DENM$ become a square?\n",
    "completion": "\\textbf{Solution:} Given that before points M and N meet, since the quadrilateral DENM is a rectangle, it follows that NE = MD. Since $\\triangle AMD \\sim \\triangle ABC$, it follows that $\\frac{AM}{AC} = \\frac{MD}{BC}$. According to the problem, $AM = t$, thus $\\frac{t}{3} = \\frac{MD}{4}$, which implies $MD = \\frac{4}{3}t$; Since $\\triangle BEN \\sim \\triangle BAC$, it follows that $\\frac{BN}{BC} = \\frac{EN}{AC}$, which implies $\\frac{BN}{4} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}t}{3}$, so $BN = \\frac{16}{9}t$. Thus, the speed of point N is $\\frac{16}{9}$ units per second. Since at the point where N and M meet, $AM + BM = AB$, it follows that $t + \\frac{16}{9}t = 5$. Solving this equation yields $t = \\frac{9}{5}$, meaning the meeting time for M and N is $\\frac{9}{5}$. Continuing movement after N and M meet, when point N reaches point A, solving $\\frac{16}{9}t = 5$ gives $t = \\frac{45}{16}$, which means the time for point N to reach the bottom point A is $\\frac{45}{16}$. Since the rectangle DENM is a square, therefore DM = MN = EN. Before N and M meet, i.e., when $0 < t < \\frac{9}{5}$, we have $MD = \\frac{4}{3}t$, $BN = \\frac{16}{9}t$, $AM = t$. Thus, $MN = AB - AM - BN = 5 - t - \\frac{16}{9}t = 5 - \\frac{25}{9}t$, resulting in $5 - \\frac{25}{9}t = \\frac{4}{3}t$. Solving this equation yields $t = \\boxed{\\frac{45}{37}}$. After N and M meet, i.e., when $\\frac{9}{5} < t < \\frac{45}{16}$, with $BN = \\frac{16}{9}t$, $AM = t$, $MD = \\frac{4}{3}t$, we get $AN = AB - BN = 5 - \\frac{16}{9}t$, $BM = AB - AM = 5 - t$. Thus, $MN = AB - AN - BM = 5 - \\left( 5 - \\frac{16}{9}t \\right) - \\left( 5 - t \\right) = \\frac{25}{9}t - 5$, leading to $\\frac{25}{9}t - 5 = \\frac{4}{3}t$. Solving this equation yields $t = \\frac{45}{13} > \\frac{45}{16}$, which is not reasonable. Therefore, summarizing the above discussion, the speed of point N is $\\frac{16}{9}$ units per second and when $t = \\boxed{\\frac{45}{37}}$, the rectangle DENM forms a square.",
